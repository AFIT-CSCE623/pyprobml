    "  Posterior predictive distribution for the healthy levels game. Red crosses are observed data points. Left column: $N=3$. Right column: $N=12$. First row: Bayesian prediction. Second row: Plug-in prediction using MLE (smallest enclosing rectangle). We see that the Bayesian prediction goes from uncertain to certain as we learn more about the concept given more data, whereas the plug-in prediction goes from narrow to broad, as it is forced to generalize when it sees more data. However, both converge to the same answer. Adapted from \\citep  Tenenbaum99 .  \n",
