    "  Illustration of a conjugate function. Red line is original function $f(x)$, and the blue line is a linear lower bound $\\lambda x$. To make the bound tight, we find the $x$ where $\\nabla f(x)$ is parallel to $\\lambda $, and slide the line up to touch there; the amount we slide up is given by $f^*(\\lambda )$.
